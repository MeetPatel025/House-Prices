# House Price Prediction Project

### Author: MeetPatel2001

This project aims to predict house prices using various regression techniques. We explore different machine learning models and techniques to accurately predict house prices based on several features.

## Models Created and Interpreted

### 1. Random Forest
- Utilized RandomForestRegressor to build a model, which is the best-performing model with a typical miss of $27741.83 when making a prediction.

### 2. Elastic Regression
- Developed an ElasticNet regression model to understand the impact of various features on house prices.

### 3. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- Implemented GradientBoostingRegressor to leverage ensemble learning for improved predictions.

### 4. Neural Networks
- Explored the usage of Neural Networks for predicting house prices.

### 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Investigated the application of Support Vector Machines in house price prediction.

## Pre-processing the Data
- Imported necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
- Utilized techniques like imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding to preprocess the data.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Model Evaluation
- Evaluated each model's performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.
- Employed techniques like cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Analyzed the impact of different hyperparameters on model performance.

## Conclusion
- Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model with the lowest RMSE.
- Elastic Regression provided insights into feature importance and model interpretability.
- Gradient Boosting Machine demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities but required careful hyperparameter tuning.
- Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines also showed promising results but may require further optimization.

## Future Work
- Explore advanced techniques such as Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
- Experiment with feature engineering and selection to improve model performance.
- Investigate ensemble methods for combining multiple models for enhanced predictions.

## Acknowledgments
- This project was made possible by the generous support of the open-source community and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and more.
